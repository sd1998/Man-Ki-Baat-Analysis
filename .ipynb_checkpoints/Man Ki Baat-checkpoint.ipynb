      "[' There has been loss of property because of the earthquake. Not only this, when we safely rescued a new born girl who was just a week old, we felt how much power humanity has. Wherever I went overseas in the last few days, I received compliments for one thing and that was for saving citizens of 48 countries of the world in Yemen. And due to this, the world has experienced the old saying of India, â\\x80\\x9cà¤¸à¥\\x87à¤µà¤¾ à¤ªà¤°à¤®à¥\\x8b à¤§à¤°à¥\\x8dà¤®à¤\\x83â\\x80\\x9d, meaning the greatest service to humanity is to serve others. This is the centenary year of the sacrifices made by the Indian heroes and â\\x80\\x9cà¤¸à¥\\x87à¤µà¤¾ à¤ªà¤°à¤®à¥\\x8b à¤§à¤°à¥\\x8dà¤®à¤\\x83â\\x80\\x9d, meaning the greatest service to humanity is to serve others and how this phrase has been lived by our country; this year is a centenary year for this reason also. And this is also a matter of pride that about 9200 soldiers, who lost their life, were bestowed with Gallantry Award. Not only this, there were eleven such individuals who received the highest honour of Victoria Cross. About 4700 Indians had sacrificed their life especially during the World War in March 2015 in France, which has made a memorial as a mark of respect for them. There has been a controversy regarding the land where his memorial was to be built for many years. Similarly, there must be an International Centre in the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar in Delhi so that the entire world knows this sage, his thoughts and his work.', ' My dear fellow citizens, Namaskar! Farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers, drip irrigation techniques, water harvesting and water recharging, that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face. If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase. If we were to stop water from draining out for five days, for seven days, it would seep into the ground and the water level would come up. I have always said that people who visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, can also see there the underground tanks constructed about 200 years ago, that were built to save rain water. For this reason there must be crores of Indians like Kumar Krishna who have the same question in their hearts. I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day. I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, \\x93 Sir, will Ganga be cleaned?\\x94 This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga. My dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April. For this reason, the Government of India, along with the cooperation of the State Governments, has launched a campaign \\x96 \\x93From Gram Uday to Bharat Uday\\x94 \\x96 From the Rise of Villages to the Ascent of India, over the 10-day period between 14th April and 24th April. There should be due importance laid on physical and social infrastructure. There should be no school dropouts in villages and the campaign to educate the girl child (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Abhiyan) should be successfully carried out. There should be some plans to do that. Prime Minister Namaskar. I believe that when there is awareness in the family, it impacts the school and has an impact on teachers as well. It is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions, expanding the system of education, building schools, building colleges, recruiting teachers, ensuring maximum attendance of children. You must have seen the Budget of the present government. You must have noticed in the Budget that we have decided to do something unconventional. I believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future. Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore. It\\x92s true that I myself have been a cadet in the NCC and so I know firsthand how one acquires a fresh perspective through such organizations. I believe that we should infuse a new life, a new force into these organizations. My dear fellow citizens, I now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think. You must have seen for yourself that the political situation in our country is such that in the previous elections political parties made promises of giving each household 9 to 12 gas cylinders. For this reason, many committees would sit which would receive many proposals and suggestions on the issue of lessening the gas subsidy. One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders. My dear fellow citizens, this is not a small matter. I would like to salute those one crore families. One crore families giving up their subsidy on gas cylinders and in return one crore poor families getting gas cylinders with the money that is saved from the one crore families that have given up their subsidy. I would like to specially appeal to the entire political class to place implicit faith in the people. I have always felt this way, like when I felt why Class 3 and Class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews. It is true that even if the most highly placed men and women relate the best possible things in the best possible words and in the best possible manner, good news has a better impact than that. It is true that the more we give prominence to good things, the less space there will be for bad things. I have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela. I would like the Tourism Department of the Government of India and the State Government to hold a photo competition on this occasion. It\\x92s true that I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh recently and he told me that they have laid special emphasis on cleanliness. I believe that even if the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual occasion, we can turn it into a social occasion. My dear fellow citizens, I will surely meet you all once in the evening on this important occasion of Panchayati Raj Divas today.', ' Before each episode of \\x91Mann Ki Baat, \\x92suggestions pour in Aakashvani, on NarendraModiApp, come through on MyGov, by the phone and come by the means of recorded messages from every corner of the country and people of every age group, And sometimes when I take the time to view them, for me it becomes an extremely pleasant experience. In the beginning, when suggestions came in response to a certain episode of \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 , one could discern words of advice, and you could read them too, so our team always felt that many people might have had this particular habit of proffering advice. There used to be a time when climate change was a subject confined to the domain of the academic world, it used to be the topic for seminars, but today, we experience it in our everyday life and it also astounds us. Sometimes we are so busy, that we even forget to offer water to the newspaper boy, the milkman, the vegetable seller, the postman or anybody else who come to our house in peak summer days. Would you like to use this time of vacation gainfully, I offer three suggestions, it will be good if you follow all of the three but then try to do atleast one of the three. But at the same time, don\\x92t you feel that after you\\x92ve attended such summer camps, you have participated in the courses for development of personality and you reach out to those people who have no such opportunity and teach them what you have learned without taking any money. And if you think that after appearing in all exams, at a new threshold of your career you will learn some new skill, then you won\\x92t get a chance. I can tell you from my experience of going around the world, that the amount we can learn by seeing the world is something we cannot even imagine. Friends, this time around, the government of India has provided you with a great opportunity. My dear countrymen, I maintain time & again that we should keep re \\x96 visiting the annals of our history, traditions and culture. This year, we the hundred & twenty five crore countrymen are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya. My dear countrymen, tomorrow, that is the 1st of May, carries one more significance. Today when I refer to Babasaheb, when I talk about Ramanujacharya, I\\x92m also reminded of the great 12th century saint & social reformer from Karnataka Jagat Guru Basaveshwar. Today when I refer to workers, it is but natural to remember Dattopant Thengdi. My dear countrymen, a few days from now, we shall celebrate Budha Purnima. My dear countrymen, India has always advanced on the path of progress in the spirit of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\\x85 inclusive development for all. My dear countrymen, the weather is too hot and inhospitable , take care of your loved ones and take care of yourselves.', ' I am happy that in a very short span of time all these schemes have been accepted in large numbers. Now the poor have this faith that they too can get money from the bank. I had the opportunity to hear them speak. My dear farmer brothers and sisters, today I would again like to especially share my Mann Ki Baat with you. Everyone felt that if the welfare of the farmers is to be achieved, if the water has to reach the fields, if poles are to be erected to provide electricity, if roads have to be constructed in the village, if houses are to be made for the poor in the village, if employment opportunities are to be provided to the poor youth of rural areas then we have to free the land from legal hassles and bureaucratic hurdles. And hence this reformed proposal was introduced. My dear farmers, you should not be misled and definitely never be scared. And hence the task of implementing the 13 points which was left incomplete in the earlier act is being accomplished today. I had the opportunity to interact for hours with the distinguished scientists of the country. I had the opportunity to hear them and I was very happy to know that India is doing commendable research in the field of science. I would like to reiterate once again that our young friends take interest in science and our educational institutions should also encourage the students for the same. I had mentioned from the Red Fort that why should there be interviews for the lower posts. I had mentioned in my speech on 15th August 2015 that this tradition of interview should at least end at some level. I am happy that in such a short span of time, it has just been 15 days but the government is moving at a very fast pace. Now the poor will not have to run for recommendation. I would like to congratulate both these brothers and send my best wishes.', ' My dear countrymen, Namaskar,\\r\\nTomorrow, 29th August is the birth anniversary of hockey wizard Dhyan Chand. Dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat draws near, a very large number of suggestions are received on MyGov or NarendraModiApp. One Shri Ajit Singh ji has written on NarendraModiApp \\x96 \\x93Please, this time in \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 do talk about the education of our daughters, our \\x91Betis\\x92 and their participation in sports because they have brought laurels for the country by winning medals at the Rio Olympics.\\x94 One Shri Sachin has written to urge that in \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 this time a mention may please be made about Sindhu, Saakshi and Deepa Karmakar. And, no one can do this better than you.\\x94\\r\\nSimilarly, one Shri Satya Prakash Mehra ji has written on NarednraModiApp \\x96 \\x93In Mann Ki Baat, there is a need to focus on extra-curricular activities, especially on encouraging children and youth to play.\\x94 Thousands of people have expressed similar sentiments. State governments too should deliberate on this matter and provide their suggestions. My dear countrymen, 5th September is \\x91Teachers Day\\x92. My dear countrymen, Ganesh Utsav is drawing near. Ganesh ji removes all obstacles and let us all wish that our country, our society, our families, and each one of us may lead a life free of obstacles. Ganesh ji removes obstacles. My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be canonized, that is, accorded sainthood on 4th September. My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, a big transformation takes place. I congratulate all the Pradhans who had assembled in Allahabad with this resolve from different States; they had come from Uttrakhand, from Uttar Pradesh, from Bihar, from Jharkhand and from West Bengal. My dear countrymen, certain things touch me very deeply and my heart bows in respect to those who visualize such heartwarming initiatives. Some students wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi and some in Chhatisgarhi to their parents telling them that there should be toilets in their houses. Some students even wrote that they would rather go without celebrating birthday but the toilet must be constructed. My dear countrymen, Swachha Bharat has become the dream of each Indian. My dear countrymen, India has always tried its best to have close, cordial and vibrant relations with its neighbours. I congratulate the friends in All India Radio too for making their contribution in our foreign policy also. My dear countrymen, although you have entrusted me with the responsibilities of Prime Minister but I also am a human being just like you. Dear countrymen, you may be knowing that I have tried to send a letter, to be delivered personally through my representatives, to all those who surrendered their cooking gas subsidy on my appeal. And, she did not write to me this letter as a Prime Minister but she straightforwardly wrote \\x96 \\x93Modi Bhaiya!\\x94 I salute this wonderful mother and I also salute crores of similar mothers in India who keep doing something or the other all the time for the benefit of others despite facing many difficulties themselves. My dear countrymen, we were struggling with drought-like conditions last year but this August we have been facing the fury of floods all through. State governments, Union government, local self-government bodies, social organisations and the citizens did whatever best could be done. My dear countrymen, ours is a vast nation, full of diversities.', ' My dear countrymen, Saadar Namaskar. My dear countrymen, our country is a land of diversities \\x96 these diversities are not limited to our cuisine, life style and attire. The festival of Samvatsari is symbolic of forgiveness, non-violence and brotherhood. My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great fervor all across the country. When we speak of Ganesh Chaturthi, it is but natural to talk about Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav, that is, community celebrations of the Ganesh Festival. The festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerela. My dear countrymen, definitions of being modern are perpetually changing. My dear countrymen, I call upon you to begin a campaign, Swachchata Hi Sewa, Cleanliness is Service, at least fifteen-twenty days prior to Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October \\x96 on the lines of the age-old belief, Jal Seva Yahi Prabhu Seva, Service to Water is Service to God. The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has created a section on MyGov.in where after constructing a toilet you can register your name and the name of the beneficiary family, who you helped. The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has organized, the Swachch Sankalp se Swachcha Siddhi Pratiyogita, From the resolve of Cleanliness to attaining Cleanliness Competition comprising an essay competition, a short film making competition and a painting competition. My dear countrymen, I want to specially express my indebtedness to you. Don\\x92t you feel that whenever a vendor comes to your door to sell something, on his rounds, when we come into contact with small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, auto rickshaw drivers \\x96 in fact any person who earns through sheer hard work \\x96 we start bargaining with him, haggling with him: \\x93No not so much, make it two rupees less, five rupees less!\\x94 And it is us, the same people, who go to dine at a fine restaurant, we don\\x92t even bother to check the bill, we just go ahead and pay the money, without thinking twice. Not just this, when we go to a showroom to buy a saree, we don\\x92t bargain, but when it comes to someone poor, we just cannot resist bargaining. There was a time when the children in the family went out to play, the mother would first ask, \\x93When will you come back home?\\x94 Now the times are such that children, when they come home, they either start watching cartoons in a corner, or are glued to mobile games. There was a time when the mother would demand to know when her son would be back. The Ministry of Sports will impart training to selected emerging players. The Ministry is launching the portal tomorrow. Come, let\\x92s welcome the young visitors from all across the world with the festival of Sports, let\\x92s enjoy the sport, and create a conducive sporting atmosphere in the country. My dear countrymen, we celebrate 5th September as Teacher\\x92s Day. When we speak about transformation in our country, we must think of our teachers as we do of our mothers. Come, let\\x92s move forward with the mantra, Teach to Transform. Not just this, when a poor person sees a RuPay Card, in his pocket, he finds himself to be equal to the privileged \\x96 that if they have a credit card in their pockets, I too have a RuPay Card in mind. My dear countrymen, once again, I wish you \\x93michchamidukkadm.\\x94 Thank you very much.', ' This is a topic of great concern and demands total attention. We received more than 7000 letters on our Akashvani address. We received responses on government portal, Mygov.in, online and through e-mails. The government was also sensitized to its responsibilities in this direction. The government can no longer remain neutral to these concerns. Have you ever thought about it? Have you ever thought about our soldiers- a soldier who is so dear to his mother, the treasured son of Mother India, the brave son of the soil is hit by a bullet probably funded by the money spent on purchasing drugs. If you want to avoid drugs and save your children from this menace then foster ambition in them, give them dreams to pursue and make them individuals with a desire to achieve something in life. Have you ever followed a sportsman\\x92s life? I would like to share some views with the parents too. Our ancestors have left us certain pearls of wisdom and that is why they are known as statesmen. A saying goes like this:\\r\\nPaanch Varsh Laaw Lijiye\\r\\nDass Laaw Tadan dei\\r\\nPaanch Varsh Laaw Lijiye\\r\\nDass Laaw Tadan dei\\r\\nSut Hi Solah Varsh Mein\\r\\nMitra Sarij Gani Dei\\r\\nThis means that till 5 years of age a child should grow in the loving and tender care of his parents, by the time he is 10 the values of discipline should be inculcated in him. There should be an open conversation with him. I would like to see this inculcated in our family life. The government will fulfill the responsibilities on its end. There should be constant messages in public interest. This is a topic of national concern and I am not here to sermonize. Last week I had the opportunity to meet the Blind Cricket Team. In the past few days there was yet another important news. Our ancestors developed a beautiful tradition and today the entire world is associated with it. In the past when it was decided to celebrate the birthday Mr. Nelson Mandela, 165 countries became co-sponsors. I am thankful to all the countries that have come out in support and have honored the sentiments of the Indians and decided to observe World Yoga Day. Last week I had the chance to have a meeting with the Chief Ministers of all the states. Last week I had the chance to travel to the North East. I would like to wish all the very best of New Year hes in advance. I am thankful to you all.', ' I hope that new zeal, new excitement and new pledges may take you to new heights. This is the power of the nation. This is the hope of the nation and these are the things which carry the nation forward and it is natural that we applaud Dileep Singh and his efforts in Mann ki Baat. The power department of the state and Indian government were functional earlier as well but from the day 1000 day target to provide electricity to every village has been set, we get news everyday that power supply is available in some or the other village and the happiness of the inhabitants\\x92 knows no bounds. My dear young friends, I had some preliminary discussions about \\x93Start-up India, Stand-up India\\x94 in my speech on 15th August from the Red Fort. My dear young friends, the government will launch the entire action plan for \\x93Start-up India, Stand-up India on 16th January. For example, when a poor person works somewhere as a labourer and there is a lot of physical effort involved but if a young man innovates something which can reduce the physical effort and help the labourer- I will call it as a Start-up. This year when the government of India started the \\x91Sugamya India\\x92 programme, I was supposed to attend it, but could not make it, because of severe floods in Chennai and other areas of Tamil Nadu. So I thought that upon looking at them with our eyes we feel that they are handicapped, but experiences tell us that they have some extra power. So I thought why not use the term \\x91Divyang\\x92 instead of \\x91viklang\\x92 in our country. My dear countrymen can we make it a habit to use the word \\x91Divyang\\x92 and make it popular. I hope that you will take this forward. My dear countrymen, the government schemes will continue exist and run, but it is necessary that these schemes always remain operational. The government undertook the largest \\x91Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme\\x92 to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries with the help of \\x91Jan Dhan Account\\x92 or \\x91Aadhar Card\\x92 etc. The government money is being directly transferred to the accounts of 15 crore beneficiaries. This is a beautiful co-incidence that Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the maker of the Indian Constitution, his 125th birth anniversary will be celebrated this year. This year when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar then can we make 26th January a medium to organize debates, poetry, slogan competition regarding duties in our own schools, colleges, villages, cities and various organizations and societies.', ' To encourage this trend, to strengthen mobile banking and to inculcate the habit of making e-payments, the Government of India is launching from today encouragement schemes for consumers as well as traders. To encourage customers, the scheme is \\x91Lucky Grahak Yojana\\x92 and to encourage traders the scheme is \\x91Digi Dhan Vyapaar Yojana\\x92. Today, on 25th December, as a Christmas gift, fifteen thousand people will get rewards through a draw system, whereby each of the fifteen thousand winners will have one thousand rupees into their accounts and this will be not for today only; starting today this scheme will continue for the next 100 days. In addition, there would be a grand draw once every week for such customers in which the prize money will be in lakhs of rupees and three months later on April 14th, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there would be a mega bumper draw where rewards would be in crores of rupees. My dear countrymen, I feel delighted to learn that the awareness about how to use technology, making e-payments, making online payments is spreading very fast. I congratulate all the states and union territories, who have promoted this campaign in their own way. I congratulate Assam Government and also all those state governments who have taken such initiatives. Brothers and sisters, the informal sector occupies a major segment in our economy and in our pattern of life and mostly these people are paid wages for their labour and hard work in cash. In addition, they are also becoming entitled to the other benefits due to them. My dear countrymen, I request every month before \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 that you please give your suggestions, share your thoughts; and of the thousands of such suggestions received this time on MyGov, on NarendraModiApp, I can definitely say that 80 to 90% suggestions were pertaining to the war against corruption and black money, there was mention of demonetization. These people are the real Agents of Change, pioneers of transformation. My dear countrymen, I am experiencing one thing every moment. These people are absolutely in the wrong. The government continuously endeavours to take a feedback from them. The government, being a sensitive government, amends rules as required, keeping the convenience of the people as its foremost consideration, so that citizens are not subjected to hardships. On the other hand, as I\\x92d said earlier, on the 8th to be precise, this drive, this war is an extraordinary one. On the other hand, many people have mentioned in their letters all kinds of wrongdoing which are going on; how newer wily ways and means are being devised. The government is committed to fight all such wrongdoings and maladies. My dear countrymen, I had mentioned in last month\\x92s \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 that even amidst these hardships our farmers toiled tirelessly and broke last year\\x92s record in sowing. In the Global Competitive Report of the World Economic Forum, India has made a big leap upwards by 32 ranks. In the Global Innovation Index 2016, we have moved up 16 rungs and in the Logistics Performance Index 2016 of the World Bank, we have risen by 19 ranks. My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament became the object of ire of our countrymen. Brothers and sisters, today with pride and joy I would like to mention that a bill in connection with my government\\x92s mission on Divyangjan, that is, differently or specially abled people was passed in Parliament. The government has passed the new law in consonance with the spirit expressed by the United Nations. I congratulate all our Cricket and Hockey team players from the core of my heart. My dear countrymen, may 2017 be a year full of joy and enthusiasm; may all your resolves be crowned with success; let us scale newer heights of progress; may the poorest of the poor get an opportunity to lead a better and fuller life of happiness and contentment; may 2017 be like this for all of us.', ' On the one hand you have exams and on the other this world cup, you might be asking your younger sister to tell you the score of the match from time to time. But friends, I am there with you in your moment of crisis. I do not know who will benefit from my conversation but I will have the satisfaction to know that I was there with my young friends in the most important occasion of their life, that I was sharing my inner feelings with them. There are many people I have seen who view this as the most important challenge of their lives and they believe that a failure here means failure for life. But friends, this is not so, and so don\\x92t take undue stress. There are many points in life where competition is necessary but for self development competition with others might not be a good motivator but competing with oneself each day should be the primary motivation. If you have a sister or your friend has a sister and who is appearing in X or XII standard exam, just observe them. Last year you were sick and yet you got good marks. Last year your uncle got married, one full week got wasted but still you managed to score very well. My dear friends, do you think exams are meant to exhibit your capacity. You should think that these exams are not to demonstrate your capacity but to realize your own potential. Once you realize your potential and understand yourself, then you yourself will keep fostering your strengths this strength will translate into a new potential and so don\\x92t take exams as a medium of exhibition, take it as an opportunity. If you have faith in yourself then such things will not arise. I believe that the reason for nervousness is the lack of faith in oneself. If you have the confidence that you have mastery in some subject, you will see that out of the 5-7 subjects there are only 2-3 topics for which you are never worried. If you have mastered the subject you will not be nervous. You should trust your knowledge, your information. I believe that we should not drown in our worries; we should march ahead with the belief that victory will be ours. I do not know if they will be useful now that the exams are near. You will get good results .You will be successful, make exams a celebration, give exams in a joyful mood, enjoy achievement each day, and change the entire atmosphere. Be successful, not to defeat others but to overcome your challenges, be successful for your own pleasure. Be successful for bringing pleasure to the lives of those others living in this world. And then, whether we could celebrate Holi or not, whether we could attend uncle\\x92s marriage or not, whether I could attend friend\\x92s birthday party or not, could see the Cricket World Cup or not- all these things will become immaterial, as for now your dimensions of happiness will be very different.', ' My dear fellow citizens, Namaskar. If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free. I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking. This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night. You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesn\\x92t feel well. You must have noticed this too. Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well. So stay calm. So stay calm, get a good night\\x92s sleep, don\\x92t be over-confident but don\\x92t be pessimistic either. You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure. You must have seen his eyes don\\x92t wander off the chess board. We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird. If we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days, we would find inner peace. If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you. I would like to tell you a little thing about myself. If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. I would like to conclude my message with a couplet \\x96 \\x91It cannot be that one succeeds each time. Yes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes. You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss. Yash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, \\x93this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again\\x94, he writes, \\x93I was able to understand this paper quite easily\\x85 When I read the questions the first time, I felt I did not know the answers to them, but when I read them again, then I realised that the questions had been posed in a different way.\\x94 It is very important to understand the questions. You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them. This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses. This is the way it should be. We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures. They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams. They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed. They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible. They should help maintain their children\\x92s faith in themselves. You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science. I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists. My dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision. My dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number.', ' My dear countrymen, Namaskar. Amir Khusro has portrayed these moments of change of season in a very interesting manner. Amir Khusro has written:\\r\\nPhool rahi sarson sakal ban\\r\\nAmbwa phoote, Tesu phoole\\r\\nKoyal bole, daar daar,\\r\\nthat is,\\r\\nBehold the mustard blooming everywhere, all around Here the inflorescence on the mango tree, there the Jungle Flame blossoms\\r\\nThe nightingale can\\x92t help but sing merrily on the branches. This cost effective, efficient space programme of ISRO has become a marvel for the entire world; the world has admired this success of Indian scientists of India whole-heartedly. Particularly for my farmer brothers and sisters, our new Satellite Cartosat 2D will be immensely helpful on a whole lot of subjects such as knowing how much water is there in our existing water sources, how this should be best put to use, what things to keep in mind in this regard. It is a delight to learn that till now, under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, ten lakh people have been rewarded, over fifty thousand traders have won prizes and an amount of almost over a hundred & fifty crores rupees has been earned as prize money by people who have promoted and carried forward this great campaign. My dear countrymen, agriculture makes a very major contribution to the fundamentals of our country\\x92s economy. My dear countrymen, the government, society, institutions, organizations, in fact everyone, is making some or the other effort towards greater cleanliness. My dear countrymen, all of you get an opportunity to express your views from time to time in \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92. I get to know so many things from you. I get to know as to what all is happening on the ground, in our villages and in the hearts and minds of the poor.', ' And I believe if we touch those questions today, we shall be able to reach out to the common man in different parts of the country. And therefore, the questions asked in press conferences, or discussed in meetings \\x96 instead of those \\x96 if we discuss what comes from the heart, and repeat it, hum it, we get a new energy. And therefore, in my opinion, those questions are more important. These are the things that unite the world. (Hon\\x92ble Shri Barack Obama):\\r\\nNamaste! Thank you Prime Minister Modi for your kind words and for the incredible hospitality you have shown me and my wife Michelle on this visit and let me say to the people of India how honoured I am to be the first American President to join you for Republic Day; and I\\x92m told that this is also the first ever Radio address by an Indian Prime Minister and an American President together, so we\\x92re making a lot of history in a short time. These are the same kinds of issues that Prime Minister Modi, I know cares so deeply about here. I believe that if the United States and India join together on the world stage around these values, then not only will our peoples be better off, but I think the world will be more prosperous and more peaceful and more secure for the future. (Hon\\x92ble Shri Narendra Modi):\\r\\nBarack the first question comes from Raj from Mumbai\\r\\nHis question is, the whole world knows about your love for your daughters. (Hon\\x92ble Shri Barack Obama):\\r\\nWell first of all they very much wanted to come. They are fascinated by India, Unfortunately each time that I have taken a trip here, they had school and they couldn\\x92t leave school. They are fascinated by the culture, and the history of India, in part because of my influence I think, they are deeply moved by India\\x92s movement to Independence, and the role that Gandhi played, in not only the non-violent strategies here in India, but how those ended up influencing the non-violent Civil Rights Movement in the United States. (Hon\\x92ble Shri Narendra Modi):\\r\\nBarack said he will come with his daughters. I believe that inspiration is our strength. (Hon\\x92ble Shri Narendra Modi):\\r\\nMr. Arjun asks me a question. Question is for you \\x85\\x85:\\r\\n(Hon\\x92ble Shri Barack Obama):\\r\\nWell the question is \\x93Did you both imagine you would reach the positions that you\\x92ve reached today?\\x94\\r\\nAnd it is interesting, Mr. Prime Minister, your talking about the first time you visited White House and being outside that iron fence. (Hon\\x92ble Shri Narendra Modi):\\r\\nThank you Barack. And therefore, I never dreamt of becoming something. Even today, I have no dream of becoming something. I am thankful to Himani. There is a question for Barack from Omprakash. (Hon\\x92ble Shri Barack Obama):\\r\\nWell this is a very interesting question. (Hon\\x92ble Shri Narendra Modi):\\r\\nOmprakash wants me too, to answer the question that has been asked to Barack. I believe they have the strength and they can do it. Even today, it inspires me. There is a question for Barack, from Monika Bhatia. (Hon\\x92ble Shri Barack Obama):\\r\\nWell the question is \\x93As leaders of two major economies, what inspires you and makes you smile at the end of a bad day at work?\\x94\\r\\nAnd that is a very good question. But I tell you what inspires me, and I don\\x92t know Mr. Prime Minister if you share this view \\x96 almost every day I meet somebody who tells me, \\x93You made a difference in my life.\\x94\\r\\nSo they\\x92ll say, \\x93The Health-Care law that you passed, saved my child who didn\\x92t have health insurance.\\x94 And they were able to get an examination from a Physician, and they caught an early tumour, and now he is doing fine. (Hon\\x92ble Shri Narendra Modi):\\r\\nIndeed Barack has spoken words from the heart (Mann Ki Baat). I am thankful to Barack, he has given so much time. And I believe, this will truly become, the Mann Ki Baat of us all.', ' My dear countrymen, this is my first Mann Ki Baat of 2016. My dear countrymen, I was trying to understand the thought process of Sardar Patel a few days ago when some of his ideas grabbed my attention. And I was told that, efforts from the government organizations will result in more work for people in this sector, will generate employment of additional 18 lakh man days to fulfill the requirements, serve the needs of the government, which in turn would be a big jump in itself. My dear countrymen, I need a help from you and I believe that you will come along with me.A lot is being said in the name of farmers in our country. Let me tell you, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has got a lot of public acceptance as it is very comprehensive, simple and with technological inputs. Let me tell you, the narratives which I have received so far, are truly inspiring. My dear countrymen, cleanliness is also getting associated with beauty. My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride that India is hosting a major event from 4th to 8th of February. My dear countrymen, I had even said earlier that whatever comes to mind, I want to express it with you openly.', ' To encourage this trend, to strengthen mobile banking and to inculcate the habit of making e-payments, the Government of India is launching from today encouragement schemes for consumers as well as traders. To encourage customers, the scheme is \\x91Lucky Grahak Yojana\\x92 and to encourage traders the scheme is \\x91Digi Dhan Vyapaar Yojana\\x92. Today, on 25th December, as a Christmas gift, fifteen thousand people will get rewards through a draw system, whereby each of the fifteen thousand winners will have one thousand rupees into their accounts and this will be not for today only; starting today this scheme will continue for the next 100 days. In addition, there would be a grand draw once every week for such customers in which the prize money will be in lakhs of rupees and three months later on April 14th, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there would be a mega bumper draw where rewards would be in crores of rupees. My dear countrymen, I feel delighted to learn that the awareness about how to use technology, making e-payments, making online payments is spreading very fast. I congratulate all the states and union territories, who have promoted this campaign in their own way. I congratulate Assam Government and also all those state governments who have taken such initiatives. Brothers and sisters, the informal sector occupies a major segment in our economy and in our pattern of life and mostly these people are paid wages for their labour and hard work in cash. In addition, they are also becoming entitled to the other benefits due to them. My dear countrymen, I request every month before \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 that you please give your suggestions, share your thoughts; and of the thousands of such suggestions received this time on MyGov, on NarendraModiApp, I can definitely say that 80 to 90% suggestions were pertaining to the war against corruption and black money, there was mention of demonetization. These people are the real Agents of Change, pioneers of transformation. My dear countrymen, I am experiencing one thing every moment. These people are absolutely in the wrong. The government continuously endeavours to take a feedback from them. The government, being a sensitive government, amends rules as required, keeping the convenience of the people as its foremost consideration, so that citizens are not subjected to hardships. On the other hand, as I\\x92d said earlier, on the 8th to be precise, this drive, this war is an extraordinary one. On the other hand, many people have mentioned in their letters all kinds of wrongdoing which are going on; how newer wily ways and means are being devised. The government is committed to fight all such wrongdoings and maladies. My dear countrymen, I had mentioned in last month\\x92s \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 that even amidst these hardships our farmers toiled tirelessly and broke last year\\x92s record in sowing. In the Global Competitive Report of the World Economic Forum, India has made a big leap upwards by 32 ranks. In the Global Innovation Index 2016, we have moved up 16 rungs and in the Logistics Performance Index 2016 of the World Bank, we have risen by 19 ranks. My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament became the object of ire of our countrymen. Brothers and sisters, today with pride and joy I would like to mention that a bill in connection with my government\\x92s mission on Divyangjan, that is, differently or specially abled people was passed in Parliament. The government has passed the new law in consonance with the spirit expressed by the United Nations. I congratulate all our Cricket and Hockey team players from the core of my heart. My dear countrymen, may 2017 be a year full of joy and enthusiasm; may all your resolves be crowned with success; let us scale newer heights of progress; may the poorest of the poor get an opportunity to lead a better and fuller life of happiness and contentment; may 2017 be like this for all of us.', ' My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country. I would like to salute all our brave soldiers who thwarted the attempts by our enemies without caring for their lives. This war was fought by those mothers and sisters whose sons and brothers were fighting against the enemies at the border. This war was also fought by the daughters of our country, who were newly married and their henna were still fresh on their hands. We have received comments from five and a half lac people and I am extremely glad to mention that more than fifty thousand people took out time from their precious schedule to apply their mind and provide their suggestions on PMO applications as they considered this work important. We have received quite a few suggestions from Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai in this regard. I would like to talk about an issue which is a matter of great concern. And therefore I say that the government has taken a lot of new initiatives in this regard, be it the initiative of education on Road Safety, initiative related to road engineering or of enforcement of road safety laws and the discussion on Emergency Care to be provided post accidents. The Cashless Treatment refers to the policy for the first fifty hours post-accident \\x96 one need worry if one has money or not, who will pay the bills, leaving all this worry \\x96 one has to give primary importance to the road accident victim who is injured so that he is treated and provided the best hospital facilities at the earliest. These bunch of officials with their entire team have started such a work which has touched me immensely and I really liked it \\x96 and the work they have started is \\x91Operation Malyuddh\\x92, and upon hearing this you will feel that this subject will go in a certain direction. I would like to tell them with great pleasure that we have a separate ministry for North-Eastern region. My dear countrymen, we are extremely delighted and proud of the \\x93Mars Mission\\x94 success.', ' My dear countrymen, Namaskar! However much one cherishes all kinds of food, one has to sacrifice that. However much one would like to snuggle up in warmth during a harsh winter, one has to just get up and leave for the track and field. Come, over the next few days, let us try to the fullest extent possible to make each one of our sportspersons feel proud, to reward them for their endeavours and exertions; and today, as I speak on the Rio Olympics, I would like to mention the name of a poetry lover, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay a student of the Punjab Central University, who has sent me a poem. If we have to match its strides and move ahead, research and innovation are the keys, these are its lifelines and moving spirit. And that is why the government too has taken steps to attract the new generation toward science and research & innovation in the field of technology. And that is why I say \\x91let us aim to innovate\\x92. If we have to develop the next generation innovators, we shall have to link our children with it. And that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of \\x91Atal Tinkering Labs\\x92. My dear countrymen, while some time ago, we were concerned about a drought like situation, these days, on the one hand, we are enjoying the rains, but on the other, reports of floods are also coming in. The government, hospitals, doctors will of course do their job, but I urge that we should also be alert in ensuring that Dengue doesn\\x92t enter our homes, locality, family, for that matter, any illness connected with stagnant water. It may give you instant relief, but my dear countrymen, this random pill popping habit can land you in deep trouble. It may give you temporary succor, but we should completely stop taking antibiotics without the advice of a doctor. And that is why, it is utmost essential to take the entire course of antibiotic medicine in terms of number of tablets as well as days. The government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance. My dear countrymen, today, the whole world is concerned deeply about climate change, global warming and the environment. Some days ago, a few states taking advantage of this weather have started many campaigns in this direction and the Government of India has also passed CAMPA law, under which about 40 thousand crores rupees will go to the states for planting trees. My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa for the first time some time back. But what I want to tell you is the fact that this time I had an opportunity to meet those great men who had devoted their young lives for society fighting shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela for the ideals of equality and equal opportunity; who had spent 20 to 22 years of their lives in prison with Nelson Mandela, effectively sacrificing the entire period of their youth for the society. Equality and equal opportunity are the two biggest \\x91mantras\\x92 for any society and government. Equality and equal opportunity, compassion and fraternity, these are the paths leading us to a bright future. My dear countrymen, I have received a message from Shilpi Varma, to whom I am grateful. Some days ago, I read in a news article that a lady became a victim of fraud and cheat email, lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide. A retired gentlemen, who not only had to get his daughter married but also to build his home, one day he received an SMS, that there was a gift that had arrived from abroad and could be obtained if he deposited 2 lakh rupees as custom duty in a bank account and this gentlemen without giving any thought took out 2 lakh rupees from his hard earned life savings and sent it to some stranger. My dear countrymen these days, the Parliament Session is going on, and during the Parliament Session, I get to meet many people from across our nation. My dear countrymen, with the onset of rainy season, there is also an onset of festival season in our country. My dear countrymen there are many among us who were born after independence. I invite you to write to me about your thoughts that I, as your representative, as your Pradhan Sevak should talk about from the Red Fort. I invite you once again, come, let us remember and salute our great freedom fighters, who sacrificed their lives for India and let us move ahead with the pledge to do something for our nation.', ' My dear countrymen, Namaskar. Therefore, we have formulated a scheme for the insurance companies, especially crop insurance companies, to make them more proactive, to ensure quick settlements of claims for farmers. This time around, there have been innumerable letters and phone calls in regard to GST. I would like you to hear one such phone call: \\x96\\r\\n\\x93Namaskar, Pradhan Mantri ji, this is Neetu Garg from Gurgaon. I would like to hear your views on this. When a person from the North-East, someone living in the remote areas, in the hills or forests, writes a letter to communicate that in the beginning, he used to be apprehensive about GST wondering what it was all about, but now that he has begun to understand it, he feels that things have become much easier than before. I extend my heartiest felicitations to each and every ministry, every department and all employees of the Central and State governments involved with this process. And this is not just a tax reform; it is a new economic order that will strengthen a new culture of honesty. I would like to once again express my deep gratitude to the millions of my countrymen who have contributed to the successful achievement of this great feat with such felicity. My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of Revolution. We have been hearing this as a natural fact right from our childhood and the reason is, the Non-Cooperation Movement was launched on the 1st of August 1920; the Quit India Movement, which is also known as \\x91Agast Kranti\\x92 began on the 9th of August 1942; and on 15thAugust 1947 India became independent. This was the time when the people of India, in every part of the country \\x96 be it a village or city, the educated or illiterate, the rich or poor, everyone came together shoulder to shoulder and became a part of the \\x91Quit India Movement.\\x92 People\\x92s anger was at its peak. Millions of Indians responded to Mahatma Gandhi\\x92s clarion call and the mantra of \\x91Do or Die\\x92; they flung themselves into the struggle. Millions of the youth of the country renounced their studies, gave up their books. Mahatma Gandhi gave a call for the \\x91Quit India Movement\\x92 on 9th August, but each and every prominent leader had been imprisoned by the British Government, and it was during this time that the second generation of leadership comprising great men like Dr. Lohia, Jaiprakash Narain played a leading and pivotal role. The whole scenario of the \\x91Quit India Movement\\x92 was different and in 1942 things rose to such a point, there was such a heightened sense of intensity, that a Mahapurush like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of \\x93Do or Die.\\x94 The reason for this entire success was the people\\x92s support, people\\x92s resolve, and people\\x92s struggle. This perseverance, this struggle from 1857 to 1942 created a situation which reached its climax in 1942; the clarion call of \\x91Quit India\\x92 was such that within five years, in 1947 the British were compelled to leave India. There have been efforts towards increasing employment, poverty alleviation, and development. There have been successes. If 1.25 billion Indians, commemorate Agast Kranti Day of 9th August, and each person resolves on 15th August, that he or she will do for the country, this much as an individual, as a citizen, this much as a family, this much as a society, this much as a village, this much as a city, this much as a government department, and this much as the government; let there be millions and millions of resolves; let there be strivings for the realisation of these millions and millions of resolves. Therefore, we must take a firm resolve today. My dear countrymen, on August 15, as the nation\\x92s \\x91Pradhan Sewak\\x92, I get an opportunity to communicate with the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort. Our festivals, our celebrations are not merely occasions of joy and merriment. Our festivals are in themselves campaigns of social reform too. And this is also the time when the poor get an opportunity to earn an income and of course this adds a spontaneous joy to the festivities. This time around, there is a special significance to the observance of community Ganesh festival as a public celebration. Lokmanya Tilak ji started this great tradition, and this year marks the 125th anniversary of community Ganesh festival. Lokmanya Tilak ji started the Sarvjanik Ganeshotsav with the basic aim to inculcate the spirit of unity, enhance awareness in society, and promote the culture of togetherness. I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen for the various upcoming festivals and celebrations. My dear countrymen, we are continually seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to the country in all the fields \\x96 be it education, economic activities, social spheres or in sports \\x96 they are scaling new heights. My dear countrymen, I remind you once again of \\x91Agast Kranti\\x92, of 9th August, I remind you once again of 15th August.', ' I can say that India is full of diversities and I was able to witness so many magnificent scenes in those pictures; be it of architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers or seas. And as I understand, if some one would not have posted the picture of Belum caves in Andhra Pradesh many people would have never come to know that something like that exists in our country. I can say that 21st June, the International Yoga Day affected me in the same manner. It is our responsibility that without any artificiality we share our legacy and introduce ourselves to the world. It is our responsibility that we gift supreme Yoga teachers to the world. It is our responsibility that we can see the entire tradition of Yoga on one platform from the Universe. When people wanted to open an bank account under the Government\\x92s new scheme of Jan Dhan Yojana, how the people working in bank helped them to do so and connected millions of Indians to the bank. And this is a season of happiness. And this is true that the more care we take, healthier we would be.', ' My dear countrymen, my greetings (namaskar) to you all\\r\\nLast year, we had to endure so many trials \\x96 the scorching heat of the summer, scarcity of water, drought conditions and so on. I extend my greetings to all our farmer brethren hoping for a bountiful rainfall. I also want to share another bright news with you. I had called them to meet me, as I had a wish to see these young friends of mine, to interact with them and to experience firsthand the energy and enthusiasm within them. I also want to congratulate the people of the country that on 22nd June, our scientists at ISRO launched 20 satellites simultaneously into space, and in the process set a new record, breaking their own previous records. My dear Countrymen, \\x93Save the Girl Child, Educate the Girl Child\\x94 (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao), has already become the Mann Ki Baat, the heartfelt wish of all the people of India. And my dear countrymen, there is another significant event that all of us should take pride in. You must have noticed that all these three daughters do not hail from metro cities of India. I extend my heartiest wishes to these three daughters Avni, Bhawana and Mohana as well as their parents. My dear Countrymen, a few days ago on 21st June, the whole world organised grand shows in observance of the anniversary of the International Day for Yoga. You must have seen that last week the Indian government issued a postage stamp on \\x91Surya Namaskar\\x92 on the occasion of International Yoga Day. For this I want that among the many ads that are played on Doordarshan, there should be one ad on Yoga, how it is to be done, and what are its benefits?\\x94\\r\\nSwati ji, your suggestion is very good, but if you observe carefully you will notice that not just on Doordarshan, but these days in India and outside India too, the Indian T.V. I urge you to use\\x96 \\x93Hashtag Yoga Fights Diabetes\\x94 I repeat- \\x93Hashtag Yoga Fights Diabetes\\x94. My dear countrymen, sometimes my \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 is ridiculed a lot and is criticized much also. But today, as I speak to you on 26th June, and I want to especially say this to the new generation that this democracy that we take pride in, this democracy that has granted great power to us, every citizen has been empowered\\x85 but 26th June 1975 was also a day\\x85 the night of 25th June and the next morning, was a dark hour for the democracy of India when Emergency was imposed in India. But today, as I talk to you all on 26th June, we should not forget that our strength lies in our democracy. And the biggest dimension is that of people\\x92s participation, their attitude, their thinking. Recently, when my government completed two years of functioning, some young people of modern thinking suggested, \\x93When you talk such big things about democracy, then why don\\x92t you get your government rated by the people also.\\x94 In a way it had a tone of challenge as well as advice. These days technology has changed so much that if people get together and form a group and if they decide to misuse technology, then who knows in which direction they might take forward this survey.\\x94 They thus expressed their concern. And the biggest thing was\\x85 and this, of course, came as a surprise to me\\x85 that maximum number of people took part in this exercise through the portal of the website of the Rural Employment Scheme which is being run by the government. So you have seen that while on 26th June some years ago the voice of the people was stifled, now is the time, when the people make their decisions, they judge whether the government is doing the right thing or not, is performing well or poorly. My dear countrymen, today I want to make a special appeal for one thing. There was a time when taxes were so pervasive, that it became a habit to avoid taxation. There was a time when there were many restrictions imposed on bringing foreign goods into the country which gave rise to a lot of smuggling. My dear countrymen, I had to talk about this in Mann Ki Baat today because recently I held a two-day conclave with the Revenue Departments- all the officials of the Income Tax, Customs and Excise Departments. I urge you to come forth in this task for the betterment of our country, for the upliftment of the poor. My dear countrymen, the common man of this country is always looking for a chance to do something for the country. I had called them especially to meet me. And my dear countrymen, you will be surprised to hear, and those who are in the habit of evading tax will get a shock to know that Chandrakant Kulkarni Ji, who gets a pension of only rupees sixteen thousand, some time back wrote a letter to me saying that out of his pension of 16,000, he voluntarily wants to donate Rs. My dear countrymen, Santosh Negi from Pauri Garhwal in Uttarakhand, has called up to relate one of his experiences. My dear countrymen, you already know that number 1922 \\x85it must have become a part of your memory by now.', ' On the occasion of Lord Jagannath\\x92s Car Festival, I extend my heartiest greetings to all my fellow countrymen, and offer my obeisance to Lord Jagannath. On the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, my heartiest greetings to one and all. My dear countrymen, every Indian today, is proud and holds his head high. On the occasion of International Day of Yoga, the UN released ten stamps. I had the opportunity to go for the inaugural function, where I was told that instead of bouquets, they gift books. My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are numerous tasks to be handled. My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we take pride in Yoga, on the other we can also take pride in our achievements in space science. I extend my heartiest congratulations to him and his coach for this victory. I had the opportunity, a few days ago to be associated with the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of the renowned athlete, P.T. They should not be forced off the playing fields to be locked in rooms with books. They should study as well, if they can do well in studies, they should certainly do so, but if they have the potential and the inclination to do well in sports, that should be encouraged and supported by the school, college, family and all the people around them. My dear countrymen, let me mention once again, that this Season of Rains, with its abundance of festivals and festivities, brings with it a unique new feeling of the times. I extend my heartiest greetings to you all, until the next episode of \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92, when I shall share my thoughts with you once again.', ' My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to assure you, that all your questions and queries from different aspects that you brought to my notice would be addressed by me and I will bring consciousness and sensitivity on those subjects in my government and not let my village, my poor people, my farmer brothers will not be forced to live in this pathetic condition. I am shocked, farmers have written letters related to farming but they have also brought some other issues, like the problems they face with the village mafias and gangs. I can understand the problems related to natural calamities, but they are also facing the issues with small time businessmen. Some farmers have to drink contaminated water in their villages, some have raised concerns on the facilities to provide shelter to their cattle, and some have also mentioned that there is no facility to dispose off the dead animals, which leads to various diseases among the villagers. This suggests that today through Mann Ki Baat, the governing bodies are getting a unique chance to understand numerous problems of the farmers. I can assure you that the government will take proper steps and solve your problems promptly and help you in this difficult time. Farmers are also angry due to the unavailability of roads in villages. They are also unhappy about the increasing price of fertilizers. They are also unhappy about the fact that they are unable to educate their children, which in their wish is also a complaint. I can understand your pain. Some farmers believe that they can only hear the strategies adopted by the government, but it never reaches the villagers. I can assure all my farmer brothers and sisters that the state and central government will take proper steps actively from now on. I can understand that you are losing patience. I will try to find a full-proof solution to this. My farmer brothers, I have found one primary problem among your various questions that is the \\x91Acquisition of Land Bill\\x92, prevailing in almost all the states. I am shocked to hear these rumours spread across the country. I will try to bring the truth before you. Today, the activists, who call themselves as the supporters of farmers, also practised this law in the country, governed the country and the farmers got their share. In the year 2013, a new law was passed in haste. On the other side, we found that no state is ready to implement the law, only Maharashtra and Haryana governments under Congress rule had implemented the law who proclaim to be well-wishers of farmers, they brought an ordinance and decided to provide just half of the decided amount as compensation. With this exclusion, I mean that the farmers would receive the same compensation as they used to get under the previous law. We have modified this law and the farmers would receive four times the compensation, even if these 13 areas be used for railways or highways. Even those who were involved in the making of the law, got upset and said that this law is neither beneficial to the farmers, nor the village or to the country. My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I cannot even think of committing this sin. In the year 2013, under the dispensation of previous government, the compensation which was decided has not been modified a bit. We have also continued with the clause that in case of acquisition of land for development of the city, the land owners will receive 20% of the developed land, so that they are benefited financially at all times. We have also decided to provide employment to the children of the farmers. We have also added a new programme. We have fixed the government responsibility by adding this feature. My dear farmer brother and sisters, we all agree that the government land must be used first. My dear farmer brothers and sisters, the law was passed in the year 2014, but the states have not adopted the law yet. Farmers are still at the same place. One, I am willing to trust my states and secondly the improvement we are trying to bring in the law by trying to eliminate the drawbacks and trying to better the conditions of the farmers, even after this, if the states are not ready to support this movement, they are free to do so. My farmer brother and sisters, misunderstanding is being created that you will not get your legal rights, that you cannot approach the courts. This is not true, dear farmer brothers and sisters, what we have said whenever a project is undertake, a timeline has to be specified in terms of the number of years in which it will be completed. We have fixed the government\\x92s responsibility. Dear brother and sisters, if a road worth Rs.100 crores is made, will the corporate run away with it? The government wants that a road be made in the village, as well as hospital and the poor children get education, so monetary investment is required. Similarly, if I am making a canal, this village has got the water and we have to provide water supply to another village and the said land falls with the people of the previous village who already have water and they deny giving their consent for acquiring their land and say that we already have the water, we are not going to give consent for land acquisition for supply of water to another village. The government will make these Corridors and create these employment opportunities for the villagers. This proposal is about government ownership, it is for the betterment of the villages, betterment of the farmers of villages, it is for the betterment of the future generations of the villagers, it is for the betterment of the poor of the villages, it is to make electricity available to the villages. Dear brothers and sisters, it is our effort to see that the nation progresses and so do our farmers by increasing their yield. I will try to speed up the efforts and if somewhere injustice is being done, I will try and provide justice.', ' You must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year. Friends, I would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup to our advantage. I would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. Some people also go outside their states. We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit \\x96 we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles. I hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too. I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task. There are many employment opportunities created by tourism. Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens \\x96 we all have to come together to make this happen. When you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays, and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new, they will realise that they wasted their time. They will admire you, \\x93You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.\\x94 This will perhaps become a big thing among friends. I am confident that you will surely do it and, yes, do share with me what you have learned. Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water. And I did not have it in my mind that I would say something on this topic, but Abhi has reminded me that last year I had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds. Friends, I want to thank this boy Abhi Chaturvedi. She wrote this in one of her poems, \\x93We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water\\x85\\x94 Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do. My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term \\x96 Digital India. Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities. There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides. I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the \\x91Kisan Suvidha App\\x92 on their mobile phones. My dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more. Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted. But this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water. You must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs. There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work. My dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, \\x91Farmers\\x92 Fair\\x92. My dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April. You must have got TB.\\x94 This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast. My dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction. I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these. But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don\\x92t do something about it. My dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year. My dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all.', ' My dear countrymen, Namaskar. I am sure that my suggestions there will be of substantial help while they sit for their examinations. \\x91New India\\x92 is neither a government programme, nor is it the manifesto of a political party, nor is it a project. \\x91New India\\x92 is the clarion call of 125 crore countrymen. My dear countrymen, if we, for a moment, pause to look with empathy at the happenings in society around us, and if we try to understand these, we would be amazed to see that there are lakhs of people, who besides their own personal responsibilities are working selflessly, for society \\x96 the exploited, victimised, deprived; for the poor and the oppressed. There are many who regularly go to hospitals to serve patients. There are many who rush to donate blood, when required. There are many who try to provide food to the hungry. When there is a talk of \\x91New India\\x92, its criticism, its analysis, it counter views, are but natural, and that is a fundamental of democracy. My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to all of you. There has been a surge in various modes of digital payment after demonetisation. My dear countrymen, we must take our fight against black money and corruption to the next level. My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time, I request people for suggestions in Mann Ki Baat, numerous suggestions pour in. There has been an awareness ever since the launch of the Cleanliness Movement. There has been an increase in the disgust towards squalor. When there is awareness and active participation in the movement, it has its own significance. This movement is geared towards bringing about a change in the habit, a movement to inculcate the HABIT of cleanliness. This movement can be accomplished collectively. I am sure that this resolve that has arisen in the younger generation, in children, in students, in the youth, augurs well for achieving good results. My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the auspicious day of Ram Navami on the 5th of April, Mahavir Jayanti is on the 9th of April, and on the 14th of April is the birth Anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. My heartiest new year greetings for Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Varsh Pratipada, and Nav Samvatsar, which are two days from now. My heartiest greetings and best wishes to you all on this New Year.', ' I would like to request you all to take care of your health in this hot weather by following simple instructions, such as drinking ample amount of water and covering yourself for protection from the heat. At the same time, I would also like to request you all to take care of the birds and animals in your neighbourhood and fulfill their requirements too. At the same time, you should also think how you can contribute to the betterment of your nation from what you have learned or what you become. In order to get the benefits of Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojna, you need to invest just 330 rupees in a year, which is less than a rupee per day. I would like to speak to my fisherman brothers and sisters, to all those who are involved with fishery. There are many things for them to learn from this channel. There is no denial from the truth that the previous governments have spoken about this issue, but have never done something about it. In order to resolve this issue in a simpler direction, I have asked the government officials to find solutions to this problem. There is no requirement to run a commentary for this issue. I would like to assure you, and I would like to repeat, that our government will launch one-rank and one-Pension and provide solutions to all related issues. I would like to connect with you and help you, not just as a part of any government programme, or any political campaign, but as a reflection of my patriotism. I would like to provide all the assistance to my people who are sacrificing their lives for the country. I would like to feel what you have experienced. There are many ways to protect yourself from the summer heat, but please take care of the birds and animals around you too.', ' My dear countrymen, namaskar! I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with people\\x92s participation. You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings. I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also. And for this, I believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning, use of appropriate technology, and time-bound action, then we can achieve optimum results in drought management, for water conservation, to save every single drop of water. When I discussed with the eleven states, I noticed that even for cultivating paddy for production of rice, some of them had employed drip irrigation successfully and got higher yields, thereby also reducing the requirement for water as well as for labour. Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through \\x91Mission Bhagirathi\\x92 have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers. I urge the people of India that during this June, July, August September, we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted. And for this reason, now that the rainy season is approaching, saving water should be our priority. Water has this power, no matter how tired one is, just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed. We should also store water. We should also modernise water irrigation. I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever; I invite then as well. We all know and we were taught about it in school that there was a time when there were no coins, no currency notes; there was a barter system. If you wanted vegetables you could give wheat in return. If you wanted salt, you could give vegetables in exchange. You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card. My dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, \\x93we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals\\x85 did we get a silver or not\\x85 should we do with just a bronze or not\\x85\\x94 This happens. It is true that in the field of sports we face a lot of challenges. We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future. I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your children\\x92s results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life. Santosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines. Someone said, \\x91yellow here would have been better in place of blue.\\x92 Someone said, \\x91This line would have been better situated there instead of here.\\x92 I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.\\x94 I don\\x92t remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back. Santosh Giriji, you have the same problem that Gaurav has. I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please don\\x92t impose your expectations upon your children. You must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor. My dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track. It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more. And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration. My dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly. My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again!', ' My dear countrymen, Namaskar. Therefore I decided to pick up the habit during vacations. Therefore I request you that you tell something to the younger generation today on this topic.\\x94\\r\\nI am delighted that younger generation is taking interest in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about those who made sacrifices for the country. My dear countrymen, 5th of June is the first Monday of the month. My dear countrymen, 21st June has become a well known day world over. At a time when separatist forces are raising their ugly heads this has been India\\x92s great contribution to the world.. We have successfully connected the whole world through Yoga. At a time when People are gobbling up medicines indiscriminately and passing their days, Yoga plays a very vital role in helping people to lead a stress-free life. This will be the picture of \\x93yesterday, today and tomorrow\\x94 and will be a guarantee of a brighter tomorrow. I congratulate everyone connected with this Cleanliness programme providing strength to it. This will be a big service to humanity. Afroz Shah, and thus he has become the first Indian to achieve this distinction. I congratulate Sh. Afroz Shah, and felicitate this people\\x92s movement. I wish to congratulate the people of Riyasi Block and also the public servants of Riyasi Block. I congratulate one and all in the state. My dear countrymen, an audit and assessment of the performance of the present government in the last three years is happening all over on newspapers, social media or TV for the last 15 days.. Three years ago you vested the responsibility of \\x91Pradhan Sewak\\x92- the Chief Servant of the People upon me. I wish to congratulate those who took out time for an in depth analysis of our work, there were some praises some support and sometimes shortcomings were also pointed out, I understand the importance of all these things. My dear countrymen, I too am an ordinary citizen like you and like any ordinary citizen I too am influenced by good or bad things. Two days ago there was a launch of an analytical book on \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 at Rashtrapati Bhavan, it was attended by the Hon\\x92ble President, Hon\\x92ble Vice President , Madam Speaker of the Lok sabha and as an ordinary citizen and as an individual this was very inspirational event for me. And some time ago, I was pleasantly surprised when this book was in the news again because Akbar Sahab an artist living in Abu Dhabi, proposed that he wishes to sketch the topics on which various episodes of \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 were based, and without taking a single rupee Akbar sahab transformed \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 into art as a gesture of his love. My dear countrymen, when we shall meet next time by then monsoon rains would be lashing every corner of the country, the weather would have changed, examination results would have arrived, the journey of education will begin anew and the rains would bring a hope, pleasant fragrance, a new aroma !', ' Sometimes we think leave it\\x85 nothing is going to change, people are indifferent, they will not do anything, our country is like this. Last time I had asked them to buy at least one khadi outfit. He continues to say that he has been touring from the past many years but it is this time around no one was littering, rather they were looking for dustbins to throw their trash. I was seeing a message on the social media. Some people discuss the ruining of family life. Last time I had mentioned about our specially abled children. I was seeing their zeal and enthusiasm. I don\\x92t want to get lost in some such figures and estimates, Its my commitment that, be it 2 rupees, or 5 rupees, or millions or even billions, this is the hard-earned money of the poor people of my country and it has to come back. He has asked me to discuss this topic in \\x93Mann ki Baat.\\x94 I agree with his concern and I will definitely include this topic, in my next edition of Mann Ki Baat. If you have some experience, any information in this regard, if you have ever rescued any child from this drug addiction, if you know of any ways and means to help, if any government official has played a good role, if you give me any such information, I will convey such efforts to the public and together we will try to create an environment in each family that no child ever thinks of choosing this vice out of sheer frustration. Some people told me \\x93 Modi ji you asked us to send you suggestions on Facebook, twitter or email. Well then, if you have something to say related to Mann Ki Baat, that you hear on the radio even in the villages then do write into me on the following address\\r\\nMann Ki Baat\\r\\nAkashvani\\r\\nSansad Marg\\r\\nNew Delhi.', ' My dear countrymen, Namaste! In our country itself, we have experienced torrential rains, that too without season and for a very long duration. The government, civil society, the citizens, and the small organizations will all have to work for capacity building through scientific temperament. I am happy that a seminar workshop on table talk exercises and best practices was organized in Delhi. I am happy that, you are a farmer engaged in organic farming. I have been told that after that session the number of phone calls increased 7 times and the number of hits on the website increased 2.5 times. There can be no greater donation than this. I would like to inform those waiting for organs and those willing to donate that a national registry for organ transplantation has been launched on 27th November. Sometimes it hurts when they are laughed at. He turned this crisis into compassion and dedicated his life to social work. He turned the focus of his educational qualification in those areas. Sometimes it happens so naturally, it is so organic that one does not realize some government employee has done it. In our country there is a network of ASHA workers. There might be so many \\x93Jamuna Mani\\x94. There might be lakhs and lakhs of people around us. I request you to see it. My dear countryman, the entire world is worried about climate change. The government is running many schemes. I would like to know from the Prime Minister how this MUDRA bank can support entrepreneurs like us. I am happy that out of the 66 lakh recipients 24 lakh were women. I have been told about Mamta Sharma from Bhopal. My dear countrymen, on 31st October on the Anniversary of Sardar Patel I had discussed about \\x96 \\x93Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat\\x94 (One India, Best India). I have been told that many suggestions have been received. I have been told that the participants will all receive a certificate. It should be grand and full of life. It should be simple and effective to be able to connect everyone. There can be many ideas. I request you to utilize this good season for some kind of physical activity and exercise.', ' My dear countrymen, Namaskar. My dear countrymen, this warmth of emotion, this fervour that has been kindled in the hearts of our defence forces, our soldiers this Diwali, should this be confined to only a few occasions? They had come from different villages of the Kashmir valley, there were around 40-50 Pradhans. They had come to discuss a few points on the development of their villages; they had some demands. I want to tell such people today â\\x80\\x93 whether you reform or not is up to you, whether you respect and follow the law or do otherwise is again up to you; of course, the law will take its own course to decide on the requisite action; but, for Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, please do not play with the lives of poor people. The government does not wish that our countrymen should face undue hardships. This is the strength of my country which encompasses the spirit of service, of sacrifice and also of genuineness and honesty. The government received a message that people of tea gardens in Assam are demanding setting up of ATMs in their areas. You will be surprised and also happy to know that during this one week, these institutions received 13 thousand crore rupees. The government has also taken many important decisions, wherein priority has been accorded to our farmers and villages. I invite you all. I want to tell my worker brothers and sisters too that you have faced heavy exploitation. And, once the money is credited into your bank account, you can use your mobile phone as an e-wallet and you do not need any hi-fi smart phone for this, because even with the help of your ordinary mobile phone itself you can make purchases from the neighbourhood shops and make payments as well. You will be with me but that alone is not enough. My dear young friends, despite all these things, there is an entire generation which is ignorant in these matters. This is the speciality of our â\\x80\\x98Bharat Bhoomiâ\\x80\\x99, our motherland where GITA was created on a battlefield. But not only this, you must devote half an hour, one hour or two hours daily to educate at least 10 families about what this technology is, how this technology is to be used, how to download the Apps of your banks, how to spend money from oneâ\\x80\\x99s account, how to make payment to shopkeepers. You have to voluntarily lend your leadership to this great campaign, this Maha Abhiyan, to create a â\\x80\\x98cashless societyâ\\x80\\x99, to eradicate corruption from our country, to abolish the scourge of black money and to help people in overcoming their difficulties and problems. I invite you â\\x80\\x93 come, do not just support this transformation but become one of its leading soldiers and ensure that we achieve the desired transformation. My dear young friends, I once again earnestly appeal to you to take forward this campaign. I invite you to work for this mission individually and collectively in every school, in every college, in every university, in NCC and in NSS. My dear countrymen, now your views and your sentiments on â\\x80\\x98Mann Ki Baatâ\\x80\\x99 though your letters, on MyGov, on NaarendraModiApp keep me constantly connected with you.', ' Sometimes we think leave it\\x85 nothing is going to change, people are indifferent, they will not do anything, our country is like this.

Organ donation should become a habit as well as an instinct. The country really needs support in these things where people need to go out and help each other and the ambitious target of one per million organ donation is a very productive steps taken by the government.\\x92\\r\\nI feel that this topic is very important. The country needs more than 2.5 lakh kidneys, hearts and livers for donation per year. Organ donation is the biggest donation.

All the pradhans, collectors, parliamentarians of villages adopted under Adarsh Gram, the representatives of Indian government and state government, all had an in-depth discussion on this program. I would like to bring to your attention a few things. I would like to congratulate our Honourable parliamentarian Sri Karia Munda ji for the same. This 2nd October, on Gandhi ji\\x92s anniversary and also on the completion of one year of \\x91Clean India Campaign\\x92, I had the fortune of participating in the \\x91Safaigiri Campaign\\x92 of the India today group. He has been promoting the cleanliness program through ETV for the past one year. He has been successful in bringing together around 51 lakh children from 55-56 thousand schools of Andhra and Telangana to this mission. He has written that from last many years, this village has set out on a mission for cleanliness and more or less every generation is completely dedicated towards this cause. This will be possible because of the efforts of the people, and by the time we celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the 125 crore people of the country should be able to proudly proclaim that we have made India clean. My dear countrymen, I said this from the Red Fort on the 15th of August that there are few places where corruption is deep rooted. We will not interrupt the ongoing procedures now but from January 1st, 2016, this will come into play. Gold can become our strength. Gold can become the financial property of the nation and every Indian must contribute to this. We will not have to secure our gold now. We will not have to worry about where to put the gold and no one will come to steal the papers. This is why we are introducing it in the market and it will be available for the citizens in the coming week, before Dhanteras \\x96 5gm and 10gm of gold coins with Ashok Chakra are being introduced. My dear countrymen, 31st October is the birth anniversary of the Iron-Man of India, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. This is why diversity is the mantra of unity. My dear countrymen, I have to leave for a trip to Britain on the next day of Diwali. This is why I am saying that I am very excited about my Britain trip this time. My dear countrymen, you are connected with us through \\x93Mann ki Baat.\\x94 I keep getting your suggestions through telephone and mygov.in.', ' My dear countrymen, my heartiest and best Deepawali wishes to all of you. By lighting lamps on Diwali, we try to overcome the darkness of these social shortcomings and individual blemishes \\x96 attaining freedom from this darkness is the real essence of the festival of lights Deepawali, which we celebrate by lighting an earthen lamp, a \\x91diya\\x92. One thing that all of us know very well is that wherever in India we go, whether to the home of the richest of the rich or to the humble dwelling of the poorest of the poor, during the Diwali festival we can see a cleanliness campaign going on in every household. The Prime Minister of Canada has shared on Twitter a picture of him lighting a lamp on the occasion of Diwali. The Prime Minister of Singapore has posted a picture on Instagram and has shared it proudly with the whole world. The Prime Minister of New Zealand had recently come to India. Schools, colleges, students, villages, the underprivileged, traders, shopkeepers, political leaders, sportspersons, people from the cine world have all lit a lamp for the country\\x92s Jawans, have joined in this campaign of sending a message of greetings and salutation to our Jawans. My dear countrymen, sister Shivani, whose parental side of the family as well as her family on the side of her in- laws is full of army soldiers, has sent me a telephone message. My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is our guide forever. My dear countrymen, tomorrow, the 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great son of India who vowed to unite India and made this the sole object of his life. My dear countrymen, this is not the pain of an individual person. But the pain remains that Sardar Patel, who lived for India\\x92s unity, strove tirelessly for it, had to even endure some unpleasantness on account of it, but never ever abandoned the path of unity; but on the birth anniversary of this great SARDAR, thousands of Sardars, the family members of thousands of Sardars were killed in the aftermath of the assassination of Smt. Sardar Saheb gave us one India, now this is our collective responsibility to develop a Great India, a Shreshtha Bharat. Sardar Saheb\\x92s journey started with a struggle for farmers. Sardar Saheb had a big role in taking the Freedom movement to the farmers. My dear countrymen, during Diwali festivities, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of lights called PRAKASH UTSAV. Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings and blessings are very relevant even now and are a source of inspiration for humanity as a whole. Guru Nanak Dev picked Bhai Laalo, as his co-worker at that crucial juncture. My dear countrymen, once again let us dedicate this Diwali to our Jawans.', ' My dear countrymen, greetings to you all. This is the twelfth episode of \\x93Mann Ki Baat\\x94 and in a way it means that we have completed one year. \\x93Mann Ki Baat\\x94 \\x96 one year, many thoughts. In a democracy the power of the people is of great significance. But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking. I did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that I wrote a letter to the PM or posted on mygov.in, yet my suggestions were not accepted even once. I would like to congratulate Akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people. The governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities, energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration. \\x93Mann Ki Baat\\x94 has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again I would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform. I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme \\x93Mann Ki Baat\\x94 to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali. My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces. At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition. This exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past. This exhibition will last a few days. Look at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry. I do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought, not only should the Prime Minister think about what he said but every Indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say:\\r\\n\\x93Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner\\x94. On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days. I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like \\x93Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?\\x94 I don\\x92t get offended by all this. Look at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this. We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream. We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves. I would like to request you for 2nd October specially. I had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing, all kinds of fabric, a lot of things, but you must also own Khadi. This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again. More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Minister\\x92s residence to offer its hospitality. I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voter\\x92s registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government. In a democracy, every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually. We must all develop this habit. He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not. Similarly, I met a small girl named, Sonam Patel. Similarly, I will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids. I noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in \\x91Mann Ki Baat.\\x92\\r\\nLook what Sandeep from Haryana has to say, \\x93Sir, I want you to do \\x91Mann ki Baat\\x92 a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words.\\x94\\r\\nSandeep ji, what all will you make me do? I have also completed a year since I started \\x91Mann Ki Baat.\\x92 My \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 has in the true sense become your \\x91Mann Ki Baat.\\x92 I listen to you, I think for you, I look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through Akashvani. The government gets benefited by your suggestions.', ' My dear countrymen, Namaskar! My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces. My dear countrymen, Shri T.S. Not only this, what really surprised me was the fact that the athlete, who finished fourth in this event amongst DIVYANG persons and thus missed winning any medal, actually took less time than the gold medalist of general category in completing the race. My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat. Government of India had organized a Mega Camp for DIVYANG persons and a number of world records were established that day. Government of India created a world record in Navsari which I believe to be very important. My dear countrymen, we had launched \\x91Swachha Bharat Mission\\x92 two years ago on 2nd October, the birth anniversary of our revered Bapu. Everyone, be it a common citizen, an administrator, in Government offices or roads, bus stops or railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, from children to old persons, rural poor, farming women- everyone is contributing something in achieving cleanliness. Not only this, a cleanliness, that is Swachchhata App has been launched for people to lodge complaints concerning cleanliness and also to know about the progress in resolving these complaints. Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward in this endeavour. Government of India has also chalked out an annual calendar for its departments. My dear countrymen, one gets a special pleasure in giving, one may not realize it, but the pleasure of giving is divine. My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji and his birth centenary year commences from today. My dear countrymen, I had started \\x91Mann Ki Baat\\x92 on Vijayadashmi two years ago. Despite numerous pressures during these past two years \\x96 sometimes being tempted due the surrounding atmosphere, at times with provocations to say something with indignation \\x96 overcoming all such impulses over these two years with your blessings, I have moved through these obstacles and earnestly tried to connect with the common man through Mann Ki Baat. My dear countrymen, from next week festive season will be ushered in with Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi, preparations for Deepavali and all such activities.', ' My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you! This is the 36th episode today. \\x93Mann Ki Baat\\x94 has provided me with a unique opportunity to get connected with various feelings and positive energy of the country; emotions of our people which include their desires, expectations and at times, even grievances, which come to their minds. And when I say things in Mann Ki Baat, people from across the country send their ideas, experiences and feelings to me. I have also tried to focus on the people of the country in Mann Ki Baat, have kept it away from political hues & tried to remain connected with you with a stable mind rather than being diverted by the heat of the moment or anguish. This is the most valuable capital and enormous strength for any country. The increasing interest in Khadi has infused a new thinking in those working in the Khadi sector as well as those connected, in any way, with Khadi. With the reopening of this training centre, the new generation will get a boost in jobs in manufacturing , in weaving, in creating new things and it feels so good to see that even big corporate Houses have started including Khadi items as Diwali gifts. My dear countrymen, we had taken a resolve in last month\\x92s Mann Ki Baat and had decided to observe a 15-day Cleanliness Festival before Gandhi Jayanti. And when I say \\x93Sankalp Se Siddhi\\x94, we can see for ourselves as to how a Cleanliness Campagin is advancing towards Sankalp Siddhi, that is Attainment through Reslove. Whether it be people from the sports world, academicians, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, government employees, police, or army jawans \\x96 every one has got connected with this. I noticed something else this time \\x96 one is that we clean up a place, and the second is that we become aware and do not spread filth; but if we have to inculcate cleanliness as a habit, we must start an idea- based movement also. I congratulate Srinagar Municipal Corporation for taking this initiative towards sanitation and for their imagination to appoint an ambassador for this cause of cleanliness because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every Indian wants to go there; and if such attention is given to Cleanliness it is a very big achievement in itself. I congratulate Bilal Dar. My dear countrymen, we will have to accept the fact that history begets history and when there is a reference to history, it is but natural to recall our great men. This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deen Dayal ji. There should be a number of Run for Unity programmes in every city, every town and the weather is also such that one would enjoy running \\x96 It is essential for developing a will power of steel, like that of Sardar Saheb. This is the power of our tourism. Internalize India within yourselves. Internalize the diversities of millions of denizens of India within you. You see, if all the people of one state will do this, then I will ask the government to do a scrutiny of it and prepare publicity material based on seven common things received from each state. Similarly, whatever you have seen throughout India and whichever seven out of these you liked the best and you wish that someone should see these things, or should go there, should get information about them, then you must send photos and information of seven such tourist spots on Mygov. My dear countrymen, being a human being, there are many things that touch me too. My dear countrymen, there is a big opportunity for our younger generation between Navratra festivities and Diwali. There should not be a single school-college ground in India where we will not see our youngsters at play. My dear countrymen, Navratras are going on. May the nation move forward and may the year two thousand twenty two- 75 years of India\\x92s Independence be an attempt to realize the dreams of our freedom fighters, the resolve of 125 crore countrymen, with their tremendous hard work, courage and determination to fulfill our resolve and prepare a roadmap for five years.']\n"
